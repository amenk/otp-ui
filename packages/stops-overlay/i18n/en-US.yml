# Default messages for the StopsOverlay component and subcomponents.
# To use from a react-intl application:
# - merge the content of this file into the messages object
#   that has your other localized strings,
# - flatten the ids, i.e. convert a structure such as
#      otpUi > StopsOverlay > stopId
#   into "otpUi.StopsOverlay.stopId" (see story for an example),
# - pass the resulting object to the messages prop of IntlProvider.

otpUi:
  # TODO: Move these shared strings to a shared package.
  StopsOverlay:
    stopId: "Stop ID: {stopId}"
    stopViewer: Stop Viewer
